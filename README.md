Thought Haven Security
===

Make the secure thing easier and faster.

CryptoRandom numbers and strings, as well as single use token abstractions and an Azure table storage implementation.

## Other projects:
* [AspNetCore](https://github.com/ThoughtHaven/AspNetCore): Wrappers and helpers built on top of Microsoft's wonderful AspNetCore and MVC libraries. Get started faster and easier while following enforced best practices.
* [Azure](https://github.com/ThoughtHaven/Azure): Data abstractions and helpers around the official Microsoft Azure library so that cloud storage development feels more like working with POCOs, not TableEntities, etc.
* [Identity](https://github.com/ThoughtHaven/Identity): An alternative Identity framework for AspNetCore built on flexibility, extensibility, and code separation.
* [Core](https://github.com/ThoughtHaven/Core): Low-level libraries and helpers for use in any application.
* [Emailers](https://github.com/ThoughtHaven/Emailers): Abstractions for email messages and services, as well as a SendGrid implementation.
